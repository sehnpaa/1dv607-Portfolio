I think your model is really good and easy to understand. You have not cluttered your model with a lot of unnecessary classes but instead focused
on the most essential ones. To be honest I have a really hard finding something wrong with it. And it made me realise some things I need to think over about my
own model. When reading the conclusion for chapter 9 in Larmans book your model feels spot on.

"a useful domain model should capture the essential abstractions and information required to understand the domain in the context of the current
requirements, and aids people in understanding the domain, its concepts, terminology and relationships." [1, chap.9.18 p.267]

All the UML notation looks good. I think the model would be helpful as a developer and I also feel that a domain expert wouldn't have any 
problems understanding it. I also think that you are your model have passed the grade 2 criteria.
